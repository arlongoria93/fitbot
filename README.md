
## FITBOT
FITBOT is a web application I made in just under a week during my coding bootcamp at Full Stack Academy. The application uses these technologies:

* JavaScript
* React
* NEXT.js
* Prisma ORM
* Supabase database
* Next Auth for OAuth Login (github)

What the current application does, you choose a muscle that you would like a workout plan for and it generates a sample five exercise workout for you.

***Some stretch goals***
- Would love to add a log that you way you can go back and check what excerises you have done last
- Add different oauth logins
- Add a way to calculate last excercises done you dont have repeated ones oe exercise after another
